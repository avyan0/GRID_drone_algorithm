# GRID_drone_algorithm
Source code for algorithm scoring

This repository includes the source code of an algorithm I have created to test a user using the GRID platform on their Airgen drone landing skills. 
The algorithm can be simply run by being copied into GRID and run after the user has executed their program, or flown to the correct location.
The algorithm is adjustable to your individual circumstance; this can be done by tweaking certain values to fit your geographic location.
Once put into GRID, the algorithm can be run after the user enters their code and/or flys their drone manually.
